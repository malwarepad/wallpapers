## MalwarePad's Wallpapers
### What does this collection have?
Here you can find some nice landscape wallpapers (100+). They aren't taken by me so credits to the photographers who took these amazing shots! <b>These pictures can make your desktop look 100x cooler with no effort. </b>

### Contributing?
Yeah but only landscapes allowed. That's the only kind of wallpapers I use and you should use.

### Screenshot competition:
You can create an issue and post a screenshot of your setup (only with landscape wallpapers) and maybe I will post your image here on the ``README.md``!
